1. What is MCIT Waiver?

There are several required courses in the MCIT program.  If a student has 
sufficient prior experience with the subject matter, then he or she can 
request to waive the class requirement.  The MCIT Waiver web application 
is a webservice that handles official waiver requests from students and 
allows instructors to notify students whether their requests have been 
approved or denied. 

2. How does someone submit a waiver

To submit a waiver, a student must click on the link dedicated for students
to go to a web form.  The student must fill out each of the dedicated boxes 
and must use a seas.upenn.edu email or a cis.upenn.edu email address.  There
are also options to uploading documents such as transcripts and syllabi from 
previously taken classes as well as additional documents. 

At minimum, each waiver request is required to have a first name, last name, 
email address, replacement class, boolean indicating whether the student has 
taken the replacement class, as well as the course that the student would like
to waive. If instructors require additional information, they will be able to
deny the waiver request and ask the student to resubmit another request. 

3. How does an instructor: view, approve, deny

To view waivers, the instructor must click on the link dedicated for 
instructors.  The instructor will see all of the classes that he or she is 
the instructor for.  To view waivers for these classes, the instructor must
follow the links for the respective classes.  Each waiver request will have 
options to approve or deny.  The instructor can approve by clicking the 
approve link or deny by clicking the deny link. 

4. Summary of each class/features that have been implemented
